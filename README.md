# Visualization-Presentation-Lab-Part-1-
Handling geospatial data presents a number of challenges in data science (including a its own type of statistics, methods, models, and data file types). 
However, Python (finally) has libraries that allow us to do the most fun part of geospatial analysis: build maps.


Create a new directory in VS Code for this lab and a file called `maps.py`

Note: To open the html files to see the maps in browser, you'll need to double-click them in the directory itself, not through VS Code
After reading through 'Add a Geolocation and Adjust the Zoom Level', update the code to College Park's lat and log (38.989697, -76.937759) 
and upload a screenshot of the map.

The CSV for 'Get Data on Ecological Footprint Per Capita' can be found here: footprint.csv
For 'Adapt the Color Scheme and Opacity', here's a link to Color Brewer Links to an external site.. 
Spend some time playing around with `fill_color`, `fill_opacity`, `line_opacity', etc.
